# Predicting Used Ford Car Prices

In this project, I tackle the challenge of predicting the prices of used Ford cars. The main objectives and methodologies include:

## Linear Regression and Regularization Models

- Implementing linear regression without regularization and comparing it with Ridge and Lasso regularization models, considering all predictor variables in the problem.
- Comparison and interpretation of the models using metrics and graphical validation techniques.

## Variable Selection Methods

Exploring various supervised variable selection methods:

- **SelectKBest (r_regresion and f_regression):** Experimenting with different values of k in the SelectKBest method.
- **Sequential Selection (SFS - Backward and Forward):** Applying Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) and Sequential Backward Selection.
- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE and RFECV):** Evaluating the performance of Recursive Feature Elimination and Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation.

Constructing a comparative table with results obtained from both unsupervised and supervised variable selection techniques and providing insights into the interpretation of results.

## Regularization Methods Evaluation

- Assessing regularization methods for different values of lambda (ùúÜ).
- Building a comparative table to evaluate the importance of predictor variables and associated metrics.
- Selecting the optimal model (LR, Ridge, or Lasso) and providing reasoning for the choice.

The project aims to not only predict used Ford car prices but also to thoroughly analyze and compare various techniques, contributing to a robust understanding of the predictive modeling process.
